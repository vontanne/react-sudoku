# User Guide for the Application

## What does it mean when the space turns red after entering a number?  
This indicates that the input is incorrect for two reasons:  
1. The input matches another value in the same row or column.  
2. The input makes the rest of the board unsolvable.  

## How to Run the Application  
Navigate to the main project directory (root folder) in the terminal, then execute the following command:  

```bash
npm i
```

After completing the installation of dependencies, execute the next command:

The game will open in a browser window at the address `localhost:3000`.
